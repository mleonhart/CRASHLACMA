### CRASH Space LACMA project

CRASHLACMA, created by the Collective Research Association of Social Hacktivity (CRASHspace) and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)

CRASHLACMA is a collaboration between the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the county of Los Angeles.  Technology has a deep and rich history of disrupting systems and giving power to the people. This interactive workshop follows in the footsteps of this tradition, giving the people of Los Angeles a rare opportunity to take part in the curation process of their local county museum by enabling them with the power to choose which works are worthy of their esteemed collection.

Adding a work of art to the LACMA collection is simple: 

1. Travel around Los Angeles and find a work of art that you deem worthy of presentation within LACMA

2. Take a photo of the art piece

3. Tweet the photo and the nearest intersection to the art piece's current location hashtag #CRASHLACMA (eg. "http://my_image.png Hollywood Blvd and Vine St, 90028 #CRASHLACMA")

Once you're done, you can come and visit LACMA to view your curated work projected on the gallery walls.
